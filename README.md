# Detecting SSH Brute Force Attacks with Wazuh SIEM

## üìù Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Wazuh can be used to detect, alert, and mitigate SSH brute-force attacks within a monitored environment.

## üíª Environment Setup
- **Target machine:** Ubuntu Server (`Ubuntu-N`)
- **Attacker machine:** Kali Linux (`Kali-Hammed`)
- **Monitoring solution:** Wazuh Server with agent on the target system

## üö® Attack Simulation
Brute-force attack was executed using **THC Hydra** from the Kali Linux VM:

_hydra -l admin -P password.txt 192.168.36.135 ssh_

# SSH Brute Force Detection Using Wazuh

The attacker attempted multiple SSH login attempts using a password list.

This activity was monitored live in **Wazuh**.

---

## üéØ Detection Results

Wazuh generated real-time alerts including:

- `sshd`: Attempt to login using a non-existent user  
- `PAM`: User login failed  
- Multiple failed logins in a small period of time  

### Example Alert Details:

- **Agent:** `Kali-Hammed`  
- **Rule IDs:** `5710`, `5503`, `5551`  
- **Rule Levels:** `5`, `10 (Critical)`

## üîê Mitigation Process

- Locked down targeted user accounts.
- Set `MaxAuthTries` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to limit SSH attempts.
- Deployed `fail2ban` to automatically block IPs with repeated failures.
- Enabled **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for SSH access.
- Enhanced Wazuh rule thresholds for faster alerting.
